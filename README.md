## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## Description

This application creates a employee directory with React. With the UI broken into components, management of component states, and responses to user events, a user can view my entire employee directory at once so that they can have quick access to their employee database. When the page loads the employee directory renders on the page. The user can then filter their employees by sex or sort them by age.
